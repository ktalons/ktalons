### 📂 My Projects:
- **osTicket (Help Desk Ticketing System)**
  - [osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-install/)
  - [osTicket: Post-Installation Configuration](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-config)
  - [osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Examples](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-ticketdemo)
- **Microsoft Azure**
  - [Configuration and Deployment of Active Directory in Azure Cloud VM](https://github.com/ktalons/ad-config)
- **THREADS**
  - The THREADS (Threaded Heuristic Research, Educational, And Development Simulator) platform is an innovative educational OS simulator developed during our Spring 2025 OS Security Theory class. It bridges theoretical operating system concepts with practical, hands-on experience by simulating a realistic kernel development environment.
    > My contributions to this project included implementing a thread-safe producer–consumer queue and custom memory management routines, as well as designing priority-based FIFO scheduling queues and dynamic doubly-linked list data structures in C. I also handled synchronization using mutexes and condition variables to prevent race conditions, and led debugging efforts for tricky multi-threaded issues (adding extensive logging, step-by-step thread analysis, etc.)
