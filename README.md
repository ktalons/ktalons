### 📂 My Projects:
- **osTicket (Help Desk Ticketing System)**
  - [osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-install/)
  - [osTicket: Post-Installation Configuration](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-config)
  - [osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Examples](https://github.com/ktalons/osticket-ticketdemo)
- **Microsoft Azure**
  - [Configuration and Deployment of Active Directory in Azure Cloud VM](https://github.com/ktalons/ad-config)
- **THREADS**
  - The THREADS platform is an innovative educational OS simulator developed during our Spring 2025 OS Security Theory class. [THREADS User Manual v1.0.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21332721/THREADS.User.Manual.v1.0.pdf)
    > My contributions to this project included implementing a thread-safe producer–consumer queue and custom memory management routines, as well as designing priority-based FIFO scheduling queues and dynamic doubly-linked list data structures in C. I also handled synchronization using mutexes and condition variables to prevent race conditions, and led debugging efforts for tricky multi-threaded issues (adding extensive logging, step-by-step thread analysis, etc.)
- **SOC Infrastructure & Tooling**
  - [IAES Repository](https://github.com/IAES-Repo)
    > As a Student SOC Analyst with the University of Arizona’s Facilities Management (FM) department, I contributed to the development and configuration of our internal SOC environment. This included deploying and integrating several open-source tools such as Docker, GLPI, OpenCTI (with connectors), NGINX, Zeek, Suricata, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. I was involved in end-to-end setup—from installation and configuration to testing and optimization while also helping shape team documentation and operational workflows. This role gave me hands-on experience with SIEM pipelines, threat intelligence ingestion, alerting infrastructure, and SOC design in a real-world enterprise setting.

### 🦉 Leadership & Community:
- **Cyber Saguaro's Club CTF Capatin**
  - [Cyber Saguaro CTF Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fhcPJnkp)
    > As the CTF Captain of the University of Arizona’s Cyber Saguaro Club (elected March 2025), I lead a team of students in cybersecurity competitions and knowledge-sharing. One of my first initiatives was revamping our CTF Discord server to improve organization. By creating channels for practice, resources, and teamwork boosted our collaboration and participation. I organize regular training sessions and mini-challenges to help members build skills in reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation, and more. My focus has been on fostering an inclusive, learning-oriented community where everyone from beginners to experienced members can contribute and grow.
